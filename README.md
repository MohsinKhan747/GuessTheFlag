# Guess the Flag – SwiftUI Game

A fun and simple iOS game built using **SwiftUI** that helps users learn country flags by testing their knowledge in an engaging way.

## 🎮 Game Features

- The user is asked to tap the correct flag based on the country name displayed.
- Only wrong selections show an alert message.
- The score increases for correct answers and decreases for wrong ones (minimum score is 0).

## 🧠 How It Works

1. On each round, 3 random flags are displayed.
2. The app randomly picks one as the correct answer.
3. The player taps a flag:
   - ✅ If correct: score increases, moves to the next question.
   - ❌ If wrong: an alert is shown with the actual country, score is decreased.
4. After 8 total attempts, a final alert shows the score and gives the option to restart.
